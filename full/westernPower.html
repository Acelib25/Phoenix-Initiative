    <p class="quote">"The state of the US has become to volitile for ATLAS to just watch from the shadows. People's rights are being taken without their knowing. The media is spreading decite and hate among the people. The people are misinformed and it must end. As of today ATLAS will no longer stand by and allow this to happen. The Phoenix Initiative begins here." ~Iseden.</p>

    <p>The main goal is to promote democracy and to free the people from the government and midias hold. It's similir in natuire to the American revolution but ATLAS does not aim to change the constatution but to define it clearly so that everyone can understand it and their rights. They also plan to plant agents in the government that will ensure that the peoples right are not slowly leached away again. The agents will also ensure the media does not groom people to think certain ways or to withhold information from the people. Bias can not be wholely removed but it can be lessened.</p>
